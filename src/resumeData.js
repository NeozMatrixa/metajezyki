  skillsDescription: "I have a wide range of multimedia skills. In 2016, I completed a multimedia course in Krasnogruda, which significantly developed my knowledge in the field of photography and film editing. From 2017 I also started composing music and now I can play guitar, piano and accordion. At the same time, I was interested in computers all the time. I became interested in creating games in my second year of studies. 4th place in TK GameJam gave me the motivation to set up a department in the science club dealing with game development. Less than six months later, our club took 7th place in the Polish national game jam #ZOSTANWDOMUROBGRY. These events allowed me not only to improve my soft skills in the field of communication and team work, but also hard skills related to creating games.",
